One-line Summary: Tag for cesm1_0_4 release.


New features in CAM5.1.1
========================

. Added WACCM-X. WACCM-X is the extension of WACCM/CAM from the lower
  thermosphere to the top of the thermosphere.

. COSP updates.  Included changes are:
  - made several high-level namelist variables that control COSP.
    The new options are all meant to reduce cost by running with fewer
    subcolumns (10) and by only running cosp every 3rd time the
    radiation is run.  The new variables are:
    cosp_amwg
    cosp_lite
    cosp_passive
    cosp_active
    cosp_isccp
  - change the default mode from cosp_runall to cosp_amwg.  Add cosp_runall
    to the namelist so this mode can still be specified.
  - changed default for cosp_histfile_num from '2' to '1'.
  - changed sub-column outputs to avoid crashes when you specify
    outputs as 'A' on a monthly history file.  The subcolumn output is only
    on by default when explicitly requested via setting either
    cosp_lfrac_out=.true. or cosp_runall=.true.
  - made COSP compatible with fincl1lonlat -- so that you can run
    COSP and save COSP outputs locally.
  - Add checks to keep rain_cv and snow_cv above 0.0
  - Fixed restart bug.

Code cleanup and refactoring:
=============================

. A reference pressure module has been added and remaining references in
  the physics package to the hybrid vertical coordinates have been
  removed.  The physics package should only need information about the
  pressures at layer midpoints and interfaces.  It should not depend in any
  way on the vertical coordinate used by the dynamical core.

. The prescribed aerosol data modules were extended to be able to read in
  modal aerosol concentrations and aerosol deposition fluxes.  This was
  done to facilitate development of prescribed Modal Aerosol Model
  configurations (in progress).

. Code refactored for memory reduction in chemistry/mozart/mo_drydep.F90
  and physics/cam/radae.F90

. Removed CAM specific print_memusage messages

. CAM build system checks for the existence of a netcdff library

. mkDepends was modified to relax the restrictions on source file name
  matching module name, and only one module per source file.

. For WACCM-SC, removed QTHERMAL, QRS_AUR, QRS_CO2NIR, QRS_EUV, from the
  output files

Bugs fixed:
===========

. Added bug fix to no longer add eddy diffusion coefficient to molecular
  diffusion coefficient and eliminated redundant code.

. Bug fix to make restart history files double precision.

. Fixed a restart problem that occurs when empty_htapes=.true. in some
  configurations.  Seems to be a problem that occurs with multiple history
  file output.

. Correction to local-time averaged history output.

. Correction to sathist output of dynamics decomposed variables on
  the HOMME grid.

. Bug fixed for column data using the collect_column_output option when the
  same number of columns (but different locations) was used on multiple
  history files.

. Work around for mpi_rsend bug on the Gemini interconnect.  The Gemini
  interconnect has a performance bug for mpi_rsend and mpi_irsend.  CPP
  flag _NO_MPI_RSEND was added so that MPI_RSEND and MPI_IRSEND can be
  redefined to MPI_SEND.  _NO_MPI_RSEND is only set within the CESM
  scripts.

. Fixed the diagnostic output for effective gw diffusivity in WACCM.

. Added correction to O3 chemical loss rate diagnostic.

. Bugfix for the diagnostic output fields CLDLIQSTR and CLDICESTR.  The
  previous version was based on state values that did not contain the
  tendencies from the macrophysics package.

. Allocate statement in mo_drydep.F90 not used and was removed.  It could
  have caused problems with UNSTRUCTURED grids since the nlon_veg and
  nlat_veg variables are not defined in that case.

. Fixed timers in tphysbc.F90 and macrop_driver.F90
