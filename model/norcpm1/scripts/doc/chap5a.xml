<title>Post Processing CESM Output</title>

<para> A completed run of CESM1.0 will produce a large number of
files, each with many variables. Post processing these files presents
several unique challenges. Various techniques and tools have been
developed to meet these challenges. Each component maintains its own
post-processing utility suite that can be accessed from the <ulink
url="https://svn-ccsm-release.cgd.ucar.edu/model_diagnostics">release
code repository</ulink>.  Component post-processing utilities are
currently provided only as a service to the community. Informal
community support is provided via the <ulink
url="http://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/">CCSM bulletin board</ulink>. General
questions should be submitted to this bulletin board; however, any
bugs found in the packages should be reported to the appropriate
working group liaison.  </para>

<para> Once approval is granted for access to the release repository,
users may freely download the diagnostic packages.  Users are urged to
'export' the packages from the repository rather than checking them
out. For example: </para>

<screen>
> svn export https://svn-ccsm-release.cgd.ucar.edu/model_diagnostics/atm/cam/amwg_diag2.5
</screen>

<para>
will result in the user obtaining the post processing utilities
"amwg_diag2.5". For more details on utilizing the release repository,
please see <link linkend="download_ccsm">Downloading CESM</link> for
