Due to CMIP5 requirements, NorESM differs from CCSM4 in how it deals
with high frequency output.

- CICE and MICOM is configured by default to write all necessary fields.

- CAM and CLM is configured by default to output all necessary monthly
  and daily fields for CMIP5 relevant component sets, while 3 and 6
  hours diagnostics must be enabled by the individual user due to its
  impact on storage space and execution performance. To enable CAM and
  CLM 3 and 6 hours diagnostics, copy
  $CCSMROOT/models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/noresm_hifreqio_nl
  to $CASEROOT/user_nl_cam and copy
  $CCSMROOT/models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/noresm_hifreqio_nl
  to $CASEROOT/user_nl_clm, respectively.
